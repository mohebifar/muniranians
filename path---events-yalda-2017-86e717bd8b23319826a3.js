Yalda (birth) is the longest night of the year in the northern hemisphere, and it coincides with the birth of Mithra (the rejuvenator of Mehr religion also known as Mithraic mysteries). Mithra (not to be confused with Ahura- Mithra) was born from a virgin mother (Anahita) on December 21st-22nd of 272 BCE, and he/she reinvigorated Mehr religion (dating back to 5000 BCE, or 3750 before Zoroaster). Mithra had twelve companions and is believed to be resurrected when he/she was 65 years old. In Mithraic mysteries, red is considered a significant color as it assumed to reflect the color of fire within the Sun (Mehr). The Mithraism is practiced in many parts of Asia, Europe, Africa before and after the birth of Christianity. As an example, Mithraism was practice in Roman Empire from the first to the fourth century. There are many similarities between Christianity and Mithraism to the point that one might assume similarities are more than just a pure coincident (Dr. Nasser Engheta, Hafez Va Kishe Mehr). Nowadays, Yalda night is more about the triumph of light over darkness rather than a religious ceremony. It worth saying that the winter solstice celebration is not limited to Iranian culture, and many other societies recognize and praise this exciting night.</p> <p>MUN Iranian Student Society is hosting Yalda Night celebration on Sunday, December 17th, 2017. We invite you to join us to celebrate Yalda at an amazing venue. The event would include live music performance, and dance accompanied by tasty fruits, nuts, cookies and Persian cuisine.
